# Music-App-Data-Access-Layer
Purpose of this project was to create an application that allowed users to perform simple tasks, in a front end website,
that translated to CRUD operations in a MySQL database. Simple tasks included creating users, favoriting songs, favoriting artists, and receiving recommended songs.
The CSV files used to populate the database were originally sourced from Spotify.
